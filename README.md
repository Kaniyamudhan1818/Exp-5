# Exp - 5 STUDENT ENROLLMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:
To design and draw the UML diagrams for the Student Registration System

# SRS (Procedure):
1.Identify the main actors such as Student, Admin, and Faculty.

2.Analyze the system requirements like student registration, course selection, and record management.

3.Draw Use Case Diagram showing interactions between the actors and the system.

4.Design Class Diagram including classes such as Student, Course, Registration, and Admin with their attributes and methods.

5.Draw Activity, Sequence, and Communication Diagrams to represent the workflow and data flow between different entities.
